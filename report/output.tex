\section{Objective}
The aim of the experiment is to understand and study
coincidence spectra for the $^{241}$Am sample using the
apparatus that we have around. I will be following the
parent paper \cite{vret}, and will be relying heavily on
Filipe et al's paper \cite{filipe} for the theoretical
front.

\section{Apparatus}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Am-241 source
    \item CSpark dual channel MCA
    \item Vacuum chamber with an integrated photodiode
    \item Gamma scintillation detector
    \item PHYWE signal preamplifier (for the alpha setup)
    \item PHYWE Multi channel analyser (only for the amplification)
    \item Single channel analyser with an integrated HV power source for the gamma setup
    \item Vacuum pump and monitor
    \item BNC Cables
    \item Aluminum foil and a blackout cover
    \item Platforms
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Field Programmable Gate Array}
In this report, we will be talking mostly about studying alpha gamma coincidence as the title says, but since this project was initially about using the
provided Intel (Alterra) FPGA \cite{alterra}, I will be noting down some of the basics of what we were able to learn and do during our time with the board. Please keep in mind that since what we did concerned Intel IPs and lots of custom code, documenting exactly what we did will require us to write a whole new report just for that. Instead, I will note down why we couldn't go ahead with using a FPGA this time around. 

\subsubsection{Transfer speeds} We tried to work with two
kinds of transfer protocols, RS232 and UDP (ethernet). For
the most part, we understood what RS232 does \cite{fpga}, and were able to implement the transfer, and capture side of things quite smoothly. The thing about this is though, that RS232 supports $10,473$ bits per second of transfer speeds. Meaning we can only send one bit per microsecond. This is absolutely not useful for our cause, as we need nanosecond transfer speeds, which is possible in ethernet implementations.

We couldn't give much time for the ethernet implementation, instead, we were able to find an elegant implementation of the same, and were able to confirm that this is infact, quite possible. This is of no use though, because we had one more roadblock that made us abandon this avenue.

\subsubsection{Analog to digital conversion} We must understand that for getting data from the amplifier to the FPGA, we need to convert the base 10 voltage values to base 2 values that can be read by the GPIO pins on the board itself. But for that purpose, we will need a high speed ADC, which we unfortunately did not have. If we interface a say 13 bit ADC to the GPIO header, we can then quite easily set bin boundaries and make a MCA on the FPGA itself, which would be quite fast. We have submitted suggestions for ADCs, which can be included in the experiments that may be conducted in the next semester.


The code for all of this, can be found on my
\href{https://github.com/surelynottrue/coincidence}{repository} and the \href{https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-ethernet/}{\texttt{verilog-ethernet} repository} authored by Alex Forencich.

\subsection{Amerecium Decay}
$^{241}$Am has quite a number of possible energies for the
alpha particle, while the decay to $^{237}$Np is being
completed. Each possibility here, will be associated with a
different excited state of $^{237}$Np, which is then
deexcited, while releasing a gamma particle of the
corresponding energy. The decay scheme is represented in
figure below.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/decay.pdf}
	\caption{Decay scheme, showing the many $\alpha$ decays
    and the associated nuclear isomers of Np}
    \label{decay}
\end{figure}
Out of the energies, we will be seeing only the transitions
that are the most possible, which, for us here, is what I
have labelled \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}. `b' holds the crown
for the most probable $\alpha$ transition with the
probability of 84.8\% and then comes 'a' with the
probability of 13.1\%. Each one of the alpha particle
ejected makes a different (out of the 4) nuclear isomer. One
of them, associated with the `b' transition, makes the most
stable isomer. We call it \emph{metastable}, as its halflife is in
the order of ns, instead of \emph{prompt} isomers, which
stay back in the order of ps. which others are. Most of what
we see in gamma energy comes to this energy level, stays
there for a while, and then decays with a half-life of
$67.2$ ns

\subsection{Setup}
We use a setup where we use a NaI scintillation detector for
gamma detection, and a solid state photodiode for the alpha
detection. We pass them separately through amplifiers and
then pass it to our dual channel MCA.

For the $\alpha$ readings, we pass it through a
preamplifier, that inverts the signal and sends it over to
two daisy chained amplifiers. They are so, because we didn't
have enough amplification to bring up the voltage of the
alpha signals. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{images/detectors.pdf}
    \caption{The most general detector setup}
    \label{detect}
\end{figure}

Here in this diagram, I have represented a very simplified
view of two detectors facing a source, and I want to
calculate the coicidence counts for different relative
angles. One of the detectors, $D1$, is fixed, and the other
moves around. The angles that I will be mentioning have been
mentioned in the figure itself. 

We will start by calculating the angles $\beta$. For any
given detector, say $D1$, I can say that:
\begin{align}
   tan \beta_1 = \frac{r_1}{d_1}
\end{align}
\noindent Where $r_1$ is the radius of the face of the detector and
$d_1$ is the distance of the face from the source. Similary,
for the second detector, we can say:
\begin{align}
   tan \beta_2 = \frac{r_2}{d_2}
\end{align}

\noindent The counting rate ($s^{-1}$) for any detector can
be given by:
\begin{equation}
    N = A\epsilon \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}
\end{equation}
\noindent Where $A$ is the number of gamma rays emitted by
the radioactive source, $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of the
detector, and $\frac{\Omega}{4\pi}$ is the fraction of the
solid angle subtended by the detector face on the point
source (for our purposes now). This ratio is also called the
\emph{geometrical efficiency} of the detector. Of course
here, the `spherical cap', as we call the subtended small
cap from the detector face, has an area of $2\pi
R^2(1-cos\beta)$. We get that using a very simple integral:
\begin{align}
    I &= R^2 \int_{\phi = 0}^{2\pi} d\phi \int _{cos \beta}^{1}
    d(cos\theta) \nonumber\\
    &= 2\pi R^2 (1 - cos\beta)
\end{align}
\noindent Now we can say here that our efficiency comes down
to:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Omega}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{2}(1-cos\beta)
\end{equation}
\noindent Typically, the values of $\beta$ are small. Which
means that the radius of the detector is small, compared to
the distance from the source. Smaller values mean a smaller
geometrical efficiency, but a higher angular resolution.

Consider here, that we have two rays, one alpha, and one
gamma ray being emitted from the source. We are assuming
that $\alpha$ is detected by $D1$ and $\gamma$ by $D2$. Now
these can be either \emph{correlated} or
\emph{uncorrelated}. If both the detections occur within a
small delay window, they are said to be \emph{temporally
coincident}. The relative probability that the gamma will be
emitted at an angle $\theta$ w.r.t the $\alpha$ is given by
$W(\theta)$, and it's called the angular distribution. Given
that nuclear spins and energy conservation comes to play
here, the angles will be relative to the underlying physics
in play here. I could not go into much detail here, and I
will leave the function at $W(\theta)$ now. 

Circling back, we come to the two detector setup again.
Here, I have, the counting rates as:

\begin{align}
    N_1 &= A\epsilon_1 \frac{\Omega_1}{4\pi} \nonumber\\
    N_2 &= A\epsilon_2 \frac{\Omega_2}{4\pi}
\end{align}

If the rays are uncorrelated, the 'true' coincidences will
be given by:

\begin{equation}
    C_\nu = A \epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 \ \frac{\Omega_2}{4\pi}
    \frac{\Omega_2}{4\pi}
\end{equation}

We are assuming that at the angle that we are keeping the
detectors, we will catch correlated rays. For a given angle,
we will have a critical angle and an overlap between the
spherical caps. The overlap, which we call $\Delta \Omega$,
is what we are looking for. Because then, for correlated
events, we will have:
\begin{equation}
    C_C = A \epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 \frac{\Delta \Omega}{4 \pi}
\end{equation}

This calculation has been done with the help of Filipe et
al, and with a small addition, we can notice how his method
can be extended to include all angles. We will go on a small
geometric digression here.

For making the problem a bit simpler, we take note of the
fact that no matter what angle the particles are emitted, we
will have the same form of equations. To understand this a
bit better, we conduct a thought experiment. The
$\frac{\Delta \Omega}{4\pi}$ is proportional to the
difference in the area of the immovable detector and the
\emph{ghost area} of the movable detector. We can understand
this as if we have a mirror at an angle dependent on the
angle between the consecutive correlated emissions. So if we
have a alpha, and then a gamma being let out with a relative
angle of $\theta$, then we will have a mirror at an angle of
$\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2}$, facing the alpha detector. This
can be understood better by looking at the diagram in
figure \ref{detect}. Essentially, if we have both of the detectors at a
relative angle of $\theta$, their sperical caps will match
perfectly, thus showing us that that angle is the one we
will see maximum coincidence counts at.

After that, we can see that at any other angle, we will have
the exact same situation. The angle $\alpha$ that we take as
the amount of rotation for $D2$, is only taken from the
proper axis, that is at $\theta$ from the $D1$ detector.
With that in mind, we will go forward and set the angle here
to be $\pi$, as that makes it easier for us to imagine
scenarios. Further, just to make everyone's life simpler,
and also because of the fact that we do not have any actual
measurements for this part, I am making them be at the same
distances from the source, and allowing them to have the
same $\beta$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{images/diag.pdf}
    \caption{Detectors in XY plane}
    \label{diag}
\end{figure}

With that in mind, we can define our coordinate system and
place the center of the face of the fixed detector at
$(d\sin(\alpha/2), -d\cos(\alpha/2), 0)$ and the movable
detector at $(d\sin(\alpha/2), d\cos(\alpha/2), 0)$. That will
make the reflection to come at $(-d\sin(\alpha/2),
-d\cos(\alpha/2), 0)$.

Once we have the coordinates, calculating P and Q in the
graph is a piece of cake. We have:
\begin{align}
    P &= (-R(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2}),
    -R\cos(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2}), 0) \\
    R &= (R(\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}),
    -R\cos(\beta+\frac{\alpha}{2}), 0)
\end{align}
\noindent The equation of the plane perpindicular to the XY
plane will be given by:
\begin{equation}
    y =
    \tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})(x+R\sin(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2})) -
    R\cos(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2})
\end{equation}

We wish to compute the intersection of the two spherical
caps, which as you would imagine, can be divided into
quadrants and will have the same area in all four of those.
If we pick one of the quadrants, we will have:

\begin{align}
    -\sqrt{R^2-x^2} \leq y &\leq
    \tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})(x+R\sin(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2}))
    \nonumber\\
    &- R\cos(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2}) \\
    - R\sin(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2}) \leq x &\leq 0
\end{align}

We can then proceed to calculate the area using the usual
surface integral, with the small area:
\begin{equation}
    ds = \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2-x^2-y^2}}
\end{equation}

The area is then given by (with R set to be 1), as we need
the solid angle $\Delta \Omega$ given by:
\begin{equation}
    4\int_{-\sin(\beta-\frac{\alpha}{2})}^{0}
    \int_{-sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})(x+\sin(\beta -
    \frac{\alpha}{2}) - \cos(\beta -\frac{\alpha}{2}))}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} dy dx
\end{equation}

On integrating the equation above, we get a very complicated
solution:
\begin{align}
    4(\arccot&\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}\sin\frac{\left|\alpha\right|}{2}}{\sqrt{\cos\alpha-\cos2\beta}}\right)
    \nonumber \\&-\arccot\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}\cos\beta\sin\frac{\left|\alpha\right|}{2}}{\sqrt{\cos\alpha-\cos2\beta}}\right)
    \cos\beta)
    \label{eq:delom}
\end{align}

We see that we get for a given value of $\beta$, we obtain a
periodic function of $\alpha$, with a period of $2\pi$. In
the neighbourhood of $\alpha=0$, we see that the function is
positive and defined only for $\alpha \leq 2\beta$. At
$2\beta$, the function vanishes, which turns out to be our
critical angle. When we take $\beta \rightarrow 0$, we have
the highest angular resolution, and the rate of coincidences
matches the angular distribution function.

For our case, if we are assuming that we have a distribution
of $\theta$, instead of a solid single value, we will have
the same expression for every angle. The difference there,
will be that $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha_\theta$, where
$\theta$ is the relative angle between the particles. Then,
we will have someting like:

\begin{equation}
    \boxed{
        C_C = \int^{\theta} A\epsilon_1\epsilon_2 W(\theta) \frac{\Delta
        \Omega(\alpha_\theta, \beta)}{4\pi}
    }
\end{equation}

\section{Experiment}
For the scope of this experiment, we couldn't go very far,
but we were able to `prove' coincidence using a coincidence
heatmap. According to the theory that we have, within a
short interval of time, the maximum coincidence should occur
with the $5485.56$KeV $\alpha$ and the $59.5$KeV $\gamma$.
So logically, we should get the coincidence heatmap with the
peak at the intersection of these two energies, which we
did, and presented ahead.

\subsection{Hardware}
For the preamplification, amplification, and detection of
the alpha particle, we used the whole of PHYWE's Rutherford
experiment setup, complete with a vacuum pump and monitor.
Our only option here was to keep the sample at a
$45^{\circ}$ angle, because the sample could only fire one
way, and equal angles from both the detectors seemed the
best choice to go with. Similarly for the gamma detection,
we went with a normal NaI scintillation and SCA setup, only
using the shaping and amplification module on the equipment. 

For consolidating the two signals and as the MCA, we used
CSpark's dual input MCA, which could do $500ns$ resolution
for the coincidence. So if we had a coincidence measurement
within $500ns$, both the outputs will be high in the log.
All of our graphs have been sourced from this machine, with
their code and some of our addition.

\subsection{Spectra}
\subsubsection{Alpha}
We can clearly identify two peaks here, those two peaks have
been used to callibrate the scale for all alpha channels
here, and in the heatmap. We had some noise, and the
amplification wasn't enough, which caused the coincidence
counts to be a bit less than expected. a higher
amplification would lift actual measurements off of the mud
and make the coincidence a bit more evident.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{%
		\input{images/alpha.pgf}
	}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Gamma}
We can see a lot of peaks here, of which not all are due to
the gamma spectrum of the sample itself. One of them is due
to the silver that the sample is internally wrapped in.

The values here mostly match what we expect, and the peaks
here have been used to callibrate all the gamma related
channels here and later on.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{%
		\input{images/gamma.pgf}
	}
\end{figure}
\noindent All the plots here have been fitted with a
gaussian, and they fit quite well, as we can see.

\subsubsection{Correlation}
We move on to the final item of presentation, the
correlation heatmap. As mentioned before, this is the
heatmap, where events register if they are in the $500ns$
window. X axis goes for the alpha energy and Y axis for
gamma. If this doesn't prove it enough, we will move to the
gated coincidence graphs.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/hmap.pdf}
    \caption{Correlation heatmap}
\end{figure}

The graph below is a basic summation graph, where we are
looking at one of the energies, and seeing how it fares with
the other spectra's peak. We are looking at the peaks for
gamma. The correlated peak is the one with higher counts
than the uncorrelated peak, which was expected from the
graph before.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.8\columnwidth}{!}{%
		\input{images/corr.pgf}
	}
    \caption{Gated correlation for both the gamma peaks}
\end{figure}
We can do the correlation delay measurements with a FPGA,
but given that we do not have enough equipment for that, we
couldn't attempt that part of the experiment. The
correlation delay can be then used to find the background
and be used to find out the actual correlation heatmap.

Some other calculations can then be done to estimate the
half life of the metastable state, which our primary
reference did, and proved to a high accuracy that the
experiment is possible.

\section{Conclusion}
We were able to setup and demonstrate alpha gamma
coincidence for $^{241}$Am. The graphs came out to be as
expected, and the experiment may be considered a success.
